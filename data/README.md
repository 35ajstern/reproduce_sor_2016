# Data Details

This file explains the data used in the paper in details.

Overview: there are 14 xlsx files: 7 files are the raw data used in the paper, 7 are supplementary data used in other 8 documents having the colony/coulter counts table/plots. The author might suggest that these 8 papers contain fabriated data because one author of these documents is the RTS mentioned in the paper (True name: Anupam Bishayee https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupam-bishayee-ph-d-468bab34).

My suspect can also be seen in one of the authors' webpage (Helen Z Hill): http://www.helenezhill.com/RawData.html
